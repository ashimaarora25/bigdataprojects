I couldn't even taste much vanilla.  So, for those of you who prefer vanilla over cinnamon, there may be other brands or flavors better for you.  For those of you who like a nicely-spiced coffee, though, this is a great blend.<br /><br />Just like the bag states, this is low acid coffee. The grounds are medium brown. I used this coffee in my cappuccino maker and created a mild espresso drink, with a bit of crema, flavored with cinnamon.  It wasn't too strong and definitely not bitter.  I like the subtle flavors of this blend very much.<br /><br />I've had other Bean Coffee flavors and like them all for their consistent roasts and flavors.

I'm addicted to coffee, but it has to be good coffee or I'll wish doom and gloom on all that cross my path. Nothing is more disappointing than going into your kitchen and realizing there is nothing really good to brew in your Keurig. I have turned into a hoarder of delicious extra bold k-cups.

When you get up that early, you need great coffee.<br /><br />Now let's address rising prices. I recommend searching daily for your favorite k-cups because the prices are getting ridiculous. I picked up 24 of these for a little over 15 dollars. Yep that is expensive, but the 50 count when averaged out was even more. Coffee is much like stocks, buy low!<br /><br />Please please please, never ever change this brew!

However, we love this pasta for what it is.  It is a lot like a sponge and needs much more sauce than white pasta to not taste dry.  Our favorite way to eat it is just with real butter, salt & pepper.  (My kids want this for lunch everyday)  As far as other pasta dishes go, I find that you can't really substitute this.  Tinkyada is a good brand that is much more similar to regular white pasta if you just want the health benefits, but don't want to change your recipes very much.  The flavor of this pasta is much more rich and full than a normal white pasta, or even whole grain pasta.  It will compete with other flavors, so you have to tinker with it and find what you like it with and what you don't.  I don't think it tastes like cardboard though, we really enjoy the flavor.  All in all, the health benefits are so great, we will use this 90% of the time.  Also, I do think the penne is the best shape.  The spaghetti is difficult to work with and overcooks easily.  The penne is delicate, but turns out much better for me."

I mean, you wann 'em, and if you play your cards right over time, you gott 'em. But ahh, the catch.  If you don't use 'em, you might just lose 'em.  What's all of this have to do with fruitcake?  Well, sans any fruitcake jokes, please stand by...<br /><br />Recently, I've lost a couple of hard-earned credit cards, due to ""lack of use.""  Really?  I mean, really?!!  Is this what America has come down to?  I do all I can to establish or re-establish my basic U.S. dollar, human worthiness for unsolicited credit card offers, only to get a few, only to lose out when I don't use them for awhile?  Without warning.  ZAP!  They're gone.  Seems ""they"" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don't use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card.  Fruitcake, I say!  Fruitcake!<br /><br />So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it.  Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Amazon.  Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it.  But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed ""gourmet"" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected.  In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad.  If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other ""disposable income"" on something else.  Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake.<br /><br />Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I've been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time.  Ever since I care to remember actually.  I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake.  I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake.  Well, soon the word spread, and I've been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages.  Not that I'm complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE!  There, I said it all.  But...this particular fruitcake brand?  Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful.<br /><br />Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this.  I really did.  An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking.  Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good.  And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I've ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product.  And please don't make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would've told me the story here.<br /><br />I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I'm just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn't even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future.  Heck, this isn't even ""cake"" at all.  It's like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet ""fruits,"" and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable.  Heck, I don't even LIKE sweets generally.  I'd much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M's or Reese's peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing.  But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I've ever really loved, was/is fruitcake.  So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced?<br /><br />I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH.  Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I've always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials.  This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking.  And that, ain't good.  Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH.  And that's what this is really.  In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha!  Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that.<br /><br />Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I've found here on Amazon, I may never know if this is just me, or what.  This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Amazon delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would've felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound ""cakes"" away.  Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don't know.<br /><br />Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can.  If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away.  But I can't give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go.  And wouldn't ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I'm supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess.  And no real warranty!  Fruitcake lover/buyer beware...<br /><br />To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price.  To those of you who've tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain't that good.  A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO.  One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this..."

Unfortunately, none of those flavors come through in this product.<br /><br />Despite a honey and sugar combination being the first ingredient, the artificial sweetener dominates the flavor of this drink. A berry-fruity-acidic flavor is the next most prominent, but if i'd tried this drink blind i don't think i ever would have guessed it was supposed to be blackberry and pomegranate. I couldn't catch the faintest whiff of green tea flavor or honey, no matter how hard i tried.<br /><br />When i made my first glass of this, i probably mixed it too strong. A single packet (two servings) is supposed to go in a 16.9 ounce bottle of water, but i just mixed mine into a glass. It took a fair bit of stirring to get it to dissolve.<br /><br />My first sip was of an overwhelmingly cloying mixture. It was like being punched in the mouth with fake sugar.<br /><br />I poured half the glass out, and refilled with water. Same experience, but more of a slap than a punch. I continued pouring some out and refilling with water, hoping that at some point it would taste less like fake sugar and more like any of the components advertized on the front. Unfortunately, as i diluted it more and more, the acidic generic fruit flavor faded out, while the artificial sweetener stayed strong. Never did green tea or honey visit my tongue.<br /><br />I suppose for a person totally habituated to artificial sweeteners, this product will taste entirely different. However, if you assume based on the fact that 'honey' is featured prominently on the front of the box that this product is naturally sweetened, you're in for a nasty surprise."

The fiber was nice, the firmer texture is nice (I'm an al dente fan and hate mushy pasta), but it had a sort of grittiness and blandness that was only tolerable under lots of sauce and cheese.<br /><br />But since I have been trying to increase my hubby's fiber intake (and I prefer high-fiber pasta for myself), I decided a couple months ago to try a few new things from FG: the cheese crackers, the rotini, the lasagna.<br /><br />I tried the lasagna first and it came out terrific. I needed a box and a half for my normal lasagna size, but the texture was beautiful and held up under microwaving as leftovers.<br /><br />The cheese crackers will be a staple for me. Amazing crunch and very like Cheez-Its (a bit more tangy or bitter, but with a better crunch and superb fiber count).<br /><br />The rotini is one I need to reorder, as I've gone through the 6 boxes already. It has paired beautifully with marinara and with lite alfredo sauce, and it was excellent in an improvised supper of the rotini with artichoke hearts, garlic, EVOO, spinach, and parmesan.<br /><br />The spaghetti stays very firm, which takes a tad bit of getting used to for me, but hubby liked the texture. Went just fine with marinara and meatballs and even better for me as leftover, as it didn't get mushy at all and had nice ""tooth feel"". I made it with oil and garlic and hot pepper flakes it was delish. I also had it with vegan sloppy joe (textured soy) , cheddar, and tomato bits and it was very good.<br /><br />I do find I get quite a bit of gas when I have a generous serving, so I only eat it when I know I don't have to be out and about. :)  But that's a minor issue for me, as the high fiber and excellent firm texture and improved (imo) flavor from the original pasta they had.<br /><br />The price is a bit mad. One package of the spaghetti, for instance, is very slight. Only half pound (for those used to full pound spaghetti boxes). So, I used both boxes so I'd have leftovers for a couple days for me and hubby. Somehow, I don't understand why the equivalent size to a standard spaghetti box has to be like five to six times as much (since I can get a box of spaghetti of decent to good quality locally for a buck to a bit more). These, at this amazon price of 18 bucks for six samplers, means each box averages 3 bucks. Two boxes of spaghetti to make one pound--6 or more bucks for that quantity. Nuts. It's PASTA! They're adding fiber, not truffle oil!<br /><br />A thumbs up. It may not suit a true pasta gourmet, but it makes me very happy...except for the price. But, well, even Dreamfields (my previous higher fiber pasta, which I'll still buy from time to time) isn't cheap compared to the regular pastas<br /><br />Enjoy."

So that is what I kept feeding her without knowing what I know now that I have read this site. But it seemed ok - she had really hard poops sometimes but otherwise seemed great and her coat was soft and shiny, enough so that people commented on it. THEN after the formula change this year, the itching started and the poops became worse (hard more often.) She developed red spots in her ears and a yeast infection in each one.  Then her fur got rough, dusty looking and then started shedding more than anything I'd seen in the 2 years I had her. It seemed like she lost 1/2 her fur! The vets told me this was not likely the new food formula of her same food...well after hundreds of dollars of vet bills and a miserable summer for her all itchy all of the time, I decided to change her food. I picked Halo after talking to a friend who is in to nutrition (people and dogs.) I changed her over slowly - about 9 days. The itching and fur remained a problem...until the day she was only on Halo. Poof! No more itching - that very day no more itching. After a month her fur was shiny and soft but sparce (I'd added Halo's Dreamcoat supplement too.) After 2 months her fur is shinier, softer and more full and lush than ever. Her poops are regular like clockwork and soft - like they never were on Purina One. And she *loves* the food! (I do a mix of canned and kibble.) She has a passion for that food she never had for Purina One - even before the formula change. I wish I'd listened to my instincts and switched the food after the first symptoms! Whatever Purina did to that food is a nightmare.  Read about in on line - you'll see many people have had very bad results since the formula change last summer."

At one point, I thought they disappeared but I realized the traps were almost full and they just weren't flying around.<br />You must be diligent though, don't stop using them because you don't see anymore, wait until they are empty for a while. Don't put them too close to each other, a few feet works better. I have a small kitchen and I put one in the pantry and one on a shelf, one in my den and one in my living room. They don't just stay where they hatch so spread them around.<br /><br />I am hoping as my traps are getting less and less, this is it, but if not, I found this brand works the best.

The 28oz is only a few cents more,"This hot sauce has become a staple in my kitchen and replaced my bottle of Tabasco. Like Tabasco - it is primarily a cayenne pepper delivery device. A few drops add a lot of heat to any dish. This is NOT a watered down hot sauce like Franks, etc.<br /><br />While Tabasco seems to impart mostly heat along with a vinegar note - this product has far more subtle tastes going on beyond the heat, yet the heat is considerable and dominates. It also lingers, on your taste buds, longer than Tabasco. There is a subtle sweetness with garlic notes to this sauce. While Tabasco can taste harsh if you add enough to a dish ---- this sauce, no matter how much you add, tastes fresh and just a bit sweet.<br /><br />I wanted to say in my review that this sauce had a hint of tomato yet there are no tomatoes listed on the ingredients. I suspect what I thought was tomato is simply the sun ripened chilies and the added sugar listed on the ingredients. But to be clear - heat - lingering heat - is the primary taste<br /><br />I like this product and I'd recommend its purchase but I'm not sure it rates 5 stars because the overall flavor does not seem, in any way, exceptional. There really is just one major taste evident and that is heat - and after that only a vague hint of something else which seems to be chiles, sugar and garlic. But chiles, sugar and garlic sure beats the vinegar aftertaste evidenced in Tabasco.<br /><br />For the $5.99 I paid locally for a 28 Oz bottle --- I'm glad to have it on hand.<br /><br />As another reviewer recommended - given the potency of this stuff - you probably only want to have a single bottle on hand. Larger quantities will deteriorate over time. I'd recommend you purchase this locally and not in the 2/3/6 packs offered on Amazon. I doubt many households will go through a bottle in a year. As I said: this is potent stuff.<br /><br />Update (July 2010) - a formal taste test<br /><br />I put 4 ounces of tomato juice into two glasses and progressively added 1/8 teaspoon of Tabasco or Huy Fong Sriracha into one of the two glasses until they both became too ""hot"" to taste<br /><br />Results: With Tabasco - with each added dose the juice became not only hotter but harsher. With the Huy Fong - it became hotter yet retained a very fresh but sweeter note"

So many other varieties of beef jerky are like dry, stale wood chips that you can break your teeth on.  These have an incredible texture, with many huge cuts of meat that are still tender and moist in the center.  They still have the jaw workout that sort of defines beef jerky, but unlike so many other brands they're still recognizable as meat, and good meat at that.  The flavor is much as advertised, which may be a bit too spicy for some, but I love it.  It's heat that very slowly builds, so if you ate a couple of pieces you might not feel it, but after downing a full package you'll be reaching for a vanilla frappe.  The unfortunate thing is that they're hard to find where I live (Cape Cod/Rhode Island), the only place that routinely stocks is Cumberland Farms, and sad to say they seem to have been disappearing even from there.  It will be a real shame if they're discontinued, as in a mass produced snack world full of mediocre, predictable, unsatisfying fodder, Jack Links sweet and hot is the sort of thing you can make a satisfying meal of."

20358,B001BDDTB2,A10U8DJAPJJI8I,"William Hefner ""William Van Hefner""",3,5,1,1227916800,#1 Ingredient is Mostly Water,"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me."

So, taste wise, gluten-free brownies tend to be fairly comparable to regular brownies. These are rich, chocolaty, and delicious. As for texture, typical gluten-free brownies are dense and feel more like fudge than brownies. These brownies, though a little dense are a little lighter than most mixes and gives the feeling of a standard brownie.

After purchasing two books on the benefits of coconut oil, I have purchased several different brands of oil.  The Nutiva Organic EVCO is by far a superior oil with a delightful flavor.  The price from Amazon if you are a Prime member is the best I have found for this quality of oil.<br /><br />I began eating the oil mixed in about 1/2 cup of cottage cheese because I read on a forum that cottage cheese has properties which help the body assimilate the oil.  Since then I have expanded to many other uses.  I use the oil to sautee garlic, onions, peppers, etc for all of my soups and stir frys.  I spread it on toast and add it to my corn bread.<br /><br />In just the first week of eating coconut oil regularly I noticed that my chronic aches in my joints and muscles subsided.  My skin is smoother and blemishes began to disappear.  I began using it as a topical ointment on my hands, feet and face along with knees and elbows.  It is a much better skin conditioner than almost anything else I have used.<br /><br />I found that it also works great as a conditioner for all of my wooden cooking utensils and I rub it into my cutting boards to condition them.  It is far superior to mineral oil!<br /><br />I have introduced the oil into my husband's diet also.  He has been a Type II diabetic for about 15 years and just turned 77.  He is beginning to notice positive benefits also.  He particularly has noticed more mental acuity.  He adds the oil to his morning cereal and spreads it on his toast and really enjoys the flavor.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this wonderful Nutiva oil and appreciate its many benefits.  I find it kind of addictive.  I now look forward to adding the oil to more and more foods and it seems to make nearly everything, including eggs, soups, stews, casseroles, muffins and breads more delicious.  I highly recommend the Nutiva brand of Organic EVCO for a huge variety of uses.  To those who think it has too much coconut flavor - well, I guess you can't please everyone.  Try it and decide for yourself.  The health benefits are worth it!  This oil has given me a new energy and improved my health so positively that I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />The only downside I can mention is the plastic container.  It would be better if it were packaged in glass, but hopefully all those anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and anti-viral properties of the oil will negate the use of a plastic container ;-)"

Admittedly I should have paid more attention to this years ago but believe it or not, until recently, I just thought pet food was pet food.  Gizmo had a bladder infection a year or so ago and after learning that kidney disease is a common and deadly disease for cats, I wanted to see if switching foods would help her ward that off so she can live another happy 10 years or more.  I did research and read all about how dry food and grains is unhealthy for cats and mainly filled with undigestible ingredients.  Grains in the food cause crystals to form in the urine as the cats body tries to process them.  Higher protein foods, grain free and with a higher moisture content are what is best.  I read all the reviews here and decided to try this paw licking chicken flavor.  For starters it doesn't have that gross smell most canned cat foods do.  It seems close to human grade to me.  From the first try of this Gizmo was hooked.  Now she cries for it, rubs around me, sometimes even gets wild if I am ignoring her and jumps up onto the counter to get my attention that she wants to be fed.  After buying 2 cases on here, I decided to try some regular store bought canned food.  I just thought this may be a bit pricey to maintain and she was going through it like crazy.  I tried several different brands from Petco and several from the supermarket.  I tried to get as close to this flavor as possible with shredded chicken flavors and none of that pate stuff.  Nothing!  She will not eat a single other brand now.  She cries and cries and if I set down something different she will sniff it and walk away.  I tried being stubborn and said, well if you are hungry enough you will eat eventually.  Well she won because she actually started to lose weight.  It was incredible.  This 6lb cat won by starving herself.  So I ordered more and she is eating and happy again.  If it makes her happy and it's healthier than all the dried grain filled junk I fed her for years then I will continue to buy it"

(and yes, I HAVE tried it)","Let ME preface MY review by saying that I actually HAVE tried it and it is well worth the price! The grind is perfect for my Solofill and tastes better than any K-cup I've ever used. But here's something I do not get at all! Did that reviewer really just say ""It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can""?  I don't get it... the logic I mean. I buy a 2 liter bottle of soda when there's a birthday party or office party, picnic, etc. I KNOW that the bottle will be gone and it's cheaper by the ounce. But that doesn't keep me from buying a 12 oz. can of the same brand of soda!!! Ounce for ounce a can of soda costs FIVE times as much as a 2 liter bottle.  But it doesn't take a coffee snob to figure out after a few days that the ground coffee in that can is losing its flavor the same way a bottle of coke loses its fizz after a few days. If you don't want to spend money on Ekojava coffee packets, then at least buy whole bean coffee and grind it as you use it.<br /><br />But then I suppose someone would say ""Why not just buy K-cups then?"". Good question - easy answer (in my world anyway).<br /><br />These little sticks of coffee that are ground nicely, weighed out perfectly (instead of the freaking mess you make scooping coffee out of a can or bag), and FRESH! So far, sounds like a K-cup. BUT... I use other things to brew coffee other than a Keurig. The packets work in the Melitta I have in my office. I gave a handful of sticks to my neighbor who tried it in his drip coffeemaker. After trying it a few times, he found that one packet in a drip coffeemaker using a paper filter makes 5 cups of awesome drip coffee! Try that with a K-cup! AND JUST out of curiosity, I stopped by a very cool coffee shop in Boise, Idaho (Salt Tears... VERY cool place!) They have a pour over bar and use the Coava Kone filters instead of paper. I asked him if I could use my coffee packet instead of there DOMA coffee (one of a few roasters in Idaho I would recommend). The water was at 206 degrees and he expertly poured about a third of the water in. The coffee began to de-gas (yeah... ain't gonna happen with ground coffee from a can) and then finished off the pour and we waited. We were both pretty blown away. It was awesome.<br /><br />Bottom line? Not sure I'd recommend this to people who are happy with coffee from a can. And I am NOT knocking those who do. My father scooped Folgers from a can when I was a kid and for years I thought that was the epitome of great coffee (but then, I also used to think hamburger was the highest quality beef). But I confess... that sounds a bit condescending and I realize that many people truly enjoy simple store brand ground coffee in their Keurig. My point it, just because you own a Keurig and a Solofill, doesn't qualify you to write a review for something you've never even tried. Dude... At least try something before you review it. C'mon... really? Okay, I sound like a snob. But I guess that's my point. If you are happy with ground coffee from a can, this probably doesn't make sense. If you are more discriminating than that, and you need something to take with you that is a high quality, one cup solution, is fresh, and you want to use it anywhere in almost anything, then heck yeah... this is a great buy!!!"

Gevalia's Dark Chocolate Truffle didn't fall into this trap--it's a decent, but not great coffee on its own.  It has a little bit too much of a mocha flavor for me, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing I've found that works great is that I use the Gevalia for 1/3 of my normal grounds allocation, and my normal coffee for the other 2/3.  This yields a cup of coffee that has a nice chocolate taste, but not overwhelmingly so. (To clarify--if I'm using 3 scoops of coffee, I'll use 1 of Gevalia and 2 of my normal coffee).  Of course, I'm also the kind of guy who puts three different types of cereal into the same bowl at once, which I realize isn't for everyone.

I offered it to Nellie, who could tell it smelled good and she tried to nibble around the roll-on top not knowing what to do.  I kind of squeezed the bottle and it made the roll-on get flavored.  She then had fun licking it and she seemed to like the stuff.  She's not very picky, so I figured she would.  The smell is not that great.  You can kind of smell it when offering it to the dog.

I have no idea why, but this has been the case for every strip thus far.  So, for travel, I'd say this may not work real well for small toddlers, and definitely wouldn't be good for car interiors.

It has more nutrition than the original Kraft Mac and Cheese as well. Based on the box the vegi pasta has less sodium and cholesterol than the average mac and cheese.

So you get an item that tastes great and that is very nutritional so it wins in my book.<br /><br />With that being said the original Kraft Macaroni and Cheese comes in a 7.7 oz box and this Vegi comes in a 5.5 oz box. This is a huge difference in size if you are feeding and entire family on it. This is also more expensive than the original Kraft mac and cheese.<br /><br />For me and my family nutritional value is huge so I would rather pay a little more and get a little less so this is why I give it 5 stars.

I suspect the problem is that there are actual chunks of carrot in the food, and most cats aren't fond of carrots blocking the smell of the chicken in their meal. While the ingredients list is admirable, the chunks of chicken are very appetizing-looking, and it does appear to be as advertised- All natural- it's also not very popular in my household.<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie flavor is especially disliked by my cats, as it's very watery. The label describes this as a sauce, but it's really more like a weak broth that apparently tastes more like carrots than chicken, because even my chicken-mooching cat will not consume it. The Sesame Chicken flavor is a little more interesting to him, but he still just picks out the bigger chunks of chicken when he's really desperate, and leaves the carrots behind.<br /><br />Honestly, I really can't believe any cat would eat those carrots!<br /><br />My suggestion is to try before you commit to this size of a package, because cats' tastes vary, and in my experience, 2 out of 3 cats will only eat it if they're very, very hungry. The third is the kind of cat that will eat anything, and so she'll dig in. If you have a cat that will eat anything, then you might have some luck with this food. If your cats are a bit more picky about their food, then you may want to hold back and see if you can dig up a single can before buying a 24-pack like this.<br /><br />I respect what the company is trying to do with their food, but I really question the person who decided they were going to put chunks of vegetables in a cat food. Cats are carnivores, and sticking a carrot in their bowl is kind of an insult to them.<br /><br />...And we all know that insulting a cat when it comes to food is one of the greatest sins against cat pride one can commit.<br /><br />Remove the carrots, thicken the ""sauce"" and you might have something here."

Let me just say I love chocolate in any form, but dark chocolate is probably 4th down on the list of favorites.  That being said, I find most dark chocolate is either too bitter for my liking, often leaving me with a slight pucker in my mouth and/or a chalky after-taste.  Newman's Own Organics Dark Chocolate was a pleasant surprise on the taste front.  Yes, it's dark chocolate, but no bitter aftertaste.  It's smooth and just sweet enough to remind me of bittersweet chocolate, more than dark.<br /><br />The reason for 4 and not 5 stars has more to do with the price of being environmentally aware.  Perhaps that explains the price hike on this bar of chocolate versus some others?  I love that Newman's company puts a portion of its proceeds back into helping others, and that too may explain the price hike, but I don't have to like it.  Not when other brands are just as tasty and cost much less.<br /><br />Similar chocolate in quality and taste: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKV04E"">Dagoba Dark (59%) Semisweet Bar, 2.0-Ounces Bars (Pack of 12)</a> focuses too on being environmentally friendly.

They have ruined my screen door with their fighting.  I thought I would set this up around the perimeter of the porch to keep them away from the back door and also give my cat some peace of mind.  What the description doesn't tell you is that the fence cannot work unless the animal has contact with the ground and the wire and that it won't conduct through concrete nor can it have any brush in contact with it.  Basically, it has to be on earthen ground with absolutely no plants or anything in its way.  This would have been good to know before buying since my porch is a concrete slab followed by about 2 feet of flower beds which then goes onto common grounds (townhome).  Total waste of time, didn't even begin to set it up since the only place I would have been able to do so would have been in the way of landscapers.  Had to order the product and read the directions to find this out so beware, if you plan to use this in any situation other than a completely clear yard.  Also, only one wire will be electrified and the animal has to be in contact with it and the ground in order to get a the shock so I imagine that a cat would automatically just jump over it.

But my VERY, VERY, VERY favorite flavor is this Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle flavor.  It's just the right balance of ""coffee"" to ""flavor"" ratio.  You can taste it, but still taste the coffee.  And my kitchen smells heavenly!  But a lot of it boils down to personal taste and preferences.

I hate plain water -- and anything that will help me to be able to drink more is a good thing in my estimation. I have tried several different ""squirt"" additives (such as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4EBMG"">MIO Mango Peach, 1.62 Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>) and found them to be OK but I like this better. At first it seemed that there was a bit of a medicinal taste to the water, but either I got used to it or it faded fast, because now I don't notice it anymore. It's important to shake the bottle well, however, before squeezing it into your drink. I usually fill a tumbler with ice and water (about 16 ounces) and then squeeze the bottle and, voila, my drink is ready. I sometimes stir the additive into the water, but it doesn't really seem to be necessary to do that.<br /><br />Any time you add an artificial flavoring to a product, opinions on whether it is good or bad are going to be entirely a personal reaction. The flavor I received was fruit punch, and I must confess it's not my favorite (I'd prefer cherry), but it goes down easy when I'm really thirsty. I don't consume a lot of fruit either, so I'm glad this product offers 120% of my vitamin C daily requirement per squeeze (serving). It also contains caffeine, taurine, 40% of the RDA for some of the B vitamins and a trace amount of some minerals. NO fat, NO carbohydrates, and NO calories!<br /><br />This is a good sized-bottle so it's not something you can carry everywhere, and it has to be refrigerated after opening. It offers 24 servings (at 15 mL = 1/2 ounce) per bottle so it's about 25¢ a serving. Anyway, I like it and would really like to try another flavor. Anything to increase my water intake!"

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

Shelnutt ""Mystery Novelist""",13,15,5,1219449600,"The Bursting Flavor and Healing Power of Blessedly Beautiful, Simple Salt Crystals","These crystals have the minerals intact, which is vital to the salt benefit and function.<br /><br />I don't know when or why purveyors of salt began removing the natural mineral content, but that action involved a frightening ignorance.<br /><br />For certain types of specific health issues (see below), the minerals in the sea salt crystals seem to work better for me in their crystalline (or coarse) form, than when I grind the salt, as I do for cooking or table usage salt.<br /><br />As others have noted, mineral-rich, coarse-sea-salt freshly grinded onto food is much crisper in its culinary effect, more satisfying to the taste buds, than pre-granulated, plain table salt (which has the minerals removed, minerals found naturally in sea salt and which enhance both health benefits and flavor bursts).<br /><br />Also, old style, granulated table salt has an added disadvantage from the fairly recent addition of a variety of anti-caking chemicals, some of which contain aluminum (silicoaluminate)... which I'm concerned may be a brain cell deteriorative, possibly at baseline cause for Alzheimer's.<br /><br />If I take a pinch of salt crystals (coarse sea salt contains crystals) 2 or sometimes 4 times per day, and place them in my mouth, moving them around to dissolve the salt in saliva on my teeth and gums, I find that both teeth and gums retain a much higher degree of health.  I had begun having minor tooth aches periodically, and this practice has alleviated that.<br /><br />As noted above, I'm 60-years-old; and with a debilitating liver ailment since I was 9, I find that when I have an attack of severe abdominal and back muscle cramps (which I get fairly frequently), a pinch of sea salt crystals in my mouth will stop those cramps.  In fact, when I take small amounts of sea salt crystals regularly enough, I don't get those cramps at all.  The cause and effect is immediate and direct, so I know this works for me.  From my experience, plain table salt, or even sea salt without the mineral content will not give this beneficial effect.  (I'm guessing it's the magnesium content which works here, though, it might be the wholeness of the natural balance of the particular mineral group within unadulterated salt).<br /><br />Of course, I also drink one, preferably two glasses of water along with the salt crystals, ingesting the water before, after, or both.<br /><br />I learned about the many benefits of sea salt crystals (with the natural mineral content not having been leached away in well meaning ignorance) from Dr. Batmanghelidj's book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0970245823"">Obesity Cancer & Depression: Their Common Cause & Natural Cure</a>.  I recommend that book very highly and hope to be able to review it also.<br /><br />Dr Batman's books explain how, when, why, and how much water the body needs for optimum health, and sea salt crystals are a vital part of that program.<br /><br />Note that in this book he explains also how, when, and why a person can take too much salt and water. I suppose I'm ""lucky"" that I have a barometer for sea salt crystal needs.  When I'm not taking enough the cramps return.  During hot weather (or under other dehydrating conditions) when the body loses more salt and water, I have to increase the intake of both.<br /><br />As far as I recall, Dr. Batman hadn't mentioned the connection of sea salt to alleviate regular large muscle cramping.  That I discovered this on my own after I had been taking the sea salt regularly, due to reading Dr. Batman's book.<br /><br />Bless this man for standing up to so many medical fallacies which are literally creating diseases, then causing addiction to high cost medications which do NOT cure the ailment, but add several other ailments into a complex medical condition which piles prescriptions on top of prescriptions.<br /><br />My thanks to Amazon for providing a variety of excellent sea salt products in coarse, crystalline form.<br /><br />With Respect for the maverick M.D.'s who actually apply and teach true healing,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br />Author of several books on KINDLE and Amazon Shorts"

Clearly, a less expensive alternative was desired, if not to replace then at least supplement my use of Boost.<br /><br />Enter the No Sugar Added version of Carnation Instant Breakfast. It was originally a part of the liquid diet I was required to be on before and after the surgery, so I already knew it tasted good and was quite filling. Since I still use Boost, though, I wanted to save some money, so I continued to use it to ""boost"" my Boost supply. It's giving me the same (or similar) benefits as Boost, while costing a whole lot less (each canister has 12 servings, so 36 servings per three-pack, plus the cost of skim milk, equals saving a ton of money compared to Boost). Ordering it from Amazon has been beneficial as well, as it's almost impossible to find the NSA variety in stores, and even if you do it's usually the boxes of individual packets.<br /><br />In short, good value, good product, tastes great, quite filling.

Pill Pockets are by far the easiest method.<br /><br />Most of our animals have considered Pill Pockets as ""treats"" and readily eaten them.  Our current feline gets three pockets in the morning and three in the evening, so we go through a lot.<br /><br />One suggestion:  if your smaller pet needs to take many meds, buy the pockets designed for capsuls for dogs.  Product pricing seems to be related to the number of ""doses"", rather than the weight.  I believe the small package for cats is 1.6 oz and costs only a few $ less than this 6.6 oz package. If you go through the pockets like we do, the savings are substantial.  We simply tear off a piece of the larger pocket and wrap it around the pill.  It takes 15 seconds.<br /><br />Another suggestion is to get a selection of flavors.  Our cat goes through periods where certain flavors are unacceptable, so it is good to alternate and have backups.<br /><br />If you are really desperate, you can always use human meat baby food.  We haven't seen a cat yet that would't take that.<br /><br />Summary:  A much better way to give your pet meds than a pill shooter."

Smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop.<br /><br />There will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light-medium roast, give the Breakfast in Bed blend a try.  Very low in acidity, someone who can't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend.  But, be aware and contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees, the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine. This one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way.<br /><br />Those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere."

564456,B0036Z3ULM,A3P8WZ8E14G8SZ,Bunkster Brown,1,1,5,1298332800,Excellent popcorn!,"I was hesitant about ordering this product based on some ho-hum reviews, but I am so pleased that I did!<br /><br />Finally, I am able to make some microwave popcorn without all the fat and salt, and with assurances that it is USDA Certified Organic!  I used about a teaspoon of coconut oil with about 1/2 cup of popcorn, and made it in the plastic microwave popper sold here on Amazon.  Just that 1/2 cup made a gigantic bowl of popcorn that was probably twice the amount you get in the typical microwave bags.  It makes you realize with a slap in the face how much you've been paying for so long, to get so little!  Doing it this way takes only about two minutes longer than the convenient bags, but you get twice as much at a very small fraction of the price!!<br /><br />Honestly, I am not wild about the coconut oil on the popcorn.  I will probably continue to use it, because of the health benefits of coconut oil, and maybe I'll get used to it in a short time.  If not, I'll consider using nothing or perhaps canola oil or light olive oil.  I just don't know if I can get used to that slightly coconut-y flavor on the popcorn.  And it does add a slight oily-ness too, that I'm not crazy about.  I like my popcorn dry and unsalted, or sometimes with just a tiny bit of sea salt.  If I find, as some have stated in reviews, that a little oil is necessary to get good pops, then perhaps I will spring for a jar of ghee in my local healthfood store. (For those who aren't familiar with ghee, it is clarified butter... they skim off the solids once the butter is melted.  It has a higher smoke point and is loaded with fat!  It is also pretty expensive, although you could make it yourself at home.)  At least the slight oily-ness would have a buttery flavor instead of one that really doesn't complement the popcorn, in my opinion.  I'm sure you could make an entire bowl of popcorn with about 1/8 of a teaspoon of ghee, so the high price and high fat content might be worth the taste.<br /><br />There were some unpopped kernels in the bottom of the bowl, but honestly not that many.  There weren't any ""half-popped"" ~ which I find yummy but they're probably not good for my digestive tract anyway, so I won't miss them.  If you compared the number of unpopped kernels in my bowl to what you'd find in two bags of commercial microwave popcorn, it would probably be about the same.  So I have nothing to complain about.<br /><br />The popcorn was yummy, and now that I have a truly organic, salt free, low fat snack that's full of fiber, I will be eating popcorn a lot more often.  I have stocked up on it, and when it's gone I'll stock up again.  I'd better be sure to also stock up on dental floss, otherwise my dentist might not be too happy with me at my next cleaning appointment.<br /><br />Thumbs up!!!<br />(Slight warning on the plastic microwave bowl though... it gets EXTREMELY hot and stays hot for a while after you take it out of the microwave!  Use potholders to hold it, or you'll burn your hands like I did... I expected it to have cooled down a bit, but no...)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004W4UP"">Nordic Ware 60120 Microwaver Popcorn Popper 12 Cup</a><br /><br />Addition January 2012:  I just ordered my second half dozen batch.  I finally figured out the perfect way to make this popcorn, and it has become a staple snack.  I keep the coconut in the fridge, and use a knife to shave off a few pieces to pop a bowl.  Perfect combo is 1/3 cup corn and a few shavings of oil... perfect bowl of popped corn!  The teaspoon I was using in the beginning was too much... that was why my batch was oily and too ""coconutty"" at first.  Just a few shavings is plenty to pop it, and gives it just a very slight coconut taste (which is delicious)."
